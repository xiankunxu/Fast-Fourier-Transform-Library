# Fast-Fourier-Transform-Library
The head file FFT handler.hpp is a C++ implementation of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms. It can do the following operations:

1. Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT);
2. Radix-2 decimation in frequency fast Fourier transform(FFT) and inverse Fourier transform(IFFT);
3. Radix-2 decimation in time fast Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform;
4. Radix-3 decimation in frequency fast Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform;
5. Discrete convolution;
6. Numerical calculation of the Fourier transform of a given function.

The C++ code utilizes the template feature, makes the functions can take operation on various containers (such as array, STL vector, STL deque), and various data types (such as integer, double, and complex double, etc.)
